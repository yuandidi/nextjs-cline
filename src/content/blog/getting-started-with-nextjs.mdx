# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. It's designed to make building modern web applications easier and more efficient.

## Why Choose Next.js?

There are several reasons why Next.js has become a popular choice for developers:

1. **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js can render pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can generate static HTML files at build time, which can be served from a CDN for maximum performance.
3. **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as part of your application.
4. **File-based Routing**: The routing system is based on the file structure, making it intuitive and easy to understand.
5. **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass, making styling your application straightforward.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is simple. You can create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configurations. Once the installation is complete, you can navigate to the project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Creating Pages

In Next.js, pages are React components exported from files in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory in the newer App Router). For example, to create a home page, you would create a file at `pages/index.js` or `app/page.js`:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>This is the home page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a powerful and flexible framework for building modern web applications. With its built-in features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, it's an excellent choice for developers looking to build high-performance React applications.

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced features of Next.js, such as data fetching, dynamic routes, and deployment strategies.
